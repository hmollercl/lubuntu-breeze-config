Description: Breeze Theme Color Scheme Selector
 It lets you pick a color scheme and change the transparency of the menus.
 Color schemes are obtained from "/usr/share/color-schemes/" and when selected
 copy to "~/.config/kdeglobals". For transparency of menu the settings are in
 "~/.config/breezerc", a composition software is needed to take effect.
 Applications need restart in order to apply changes. Take into consideration
 that some file managers also manage the desktop so you need to restart that too
