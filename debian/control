Description: Breeze Theme Color Scheme Selector
 It lets you pick a color scheme from "/usr/share/color-schemes/" and copy it
 to "~/.config/kdeglobals" so system use it. Applications need restart in order
 to use it. Take into consideration that some file managers also manage the
 desktop so you need to restart that too.
